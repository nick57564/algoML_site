# Explanation of the HTML File

This document provides an overview of the HTML file used for a webpage belonging to **Algo-ML**. The file is designed using Django's templating language, which allows for dynamic content and static file handling.

## Overview

The HTML file is structured to create a responsive webpage that includes a header with navigation, multiple sections highlighting the services offered by Algo-ML, and a contact section. The webpage also includes stylesheets and JavaScript for enhanced functionality.

### Key Components

1. **Template Tags**:
   - `{% load static %}`: This tag loads the static files functionality, allowing the use of `{% static %}` for referencing static files like CSS, images, and JavaScript.
   - `{% static 'path/to/file' %}`: This tag is used to link to static files. Paths are specified relative to the static files directory.

2. **HTML Structure**:
   - The document follows the standard HTML5 structure with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, and includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections.
   - The `<head>` section contains metadata, the title of the document, and links to external stylesheets.
   - The `<body>` section contains the content of the webpage.

3. **Head Section**:
   - Includes meta tags for character set and viewport settings, ensuring the page is responsive.
   - Links to a CSS file (`home_style.css`) that styles the webpage.

4. **Header**:
   - Contains a logo and a navigation menu with links to different sections: Projects, Contact, and Algo-ML.

5. **Main Content Sections**:
   - Each section is wrapped in a `<div>` with the class `section`, giving structure to the content.
   - Sections include:
     - **Banner**: Introduces the Algo-ML brand with a decorative image.
     - **Introduction**: Provides a brief overview of the company's expertise in machine learning.
     - **Description**: Highlights the solutions offered by Algo-ML.
     - **Contact**: Lists contact information such as email, phone, and website.

6. **Images**:
   - Decorative images are included using the `<img>` tag, utilizing the `{% static %}` tag for the source path.

7. **JavaScript**:
   - A `<script>` tag at the end of the body loads a 3D model (`code.glb`) and another `<script>` that links to the main JavaScript file (`app.js`) responsible for interactive features on the webpage.
